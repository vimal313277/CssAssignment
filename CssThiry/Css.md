# Question-3

### What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?

<b>Answer:-

 <ol>
 <li>CSS3 has compatibility with external font styles through google fonts and typecast. It was not possible withearlierCSS1 and CSS2. The selectors in CSS3 hasincreased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple selectors.CSS1 AND CSS2 didn't have provision to specifically design the web layout.</li>
 <br>
 <li>CSS3 features the Selector concept, whereas CSS does not. Thus, rather than applying classes or IDs for 
        creating styles, developers can use CSS3 to choose HTML elements in place of IDs and classes as attributes to be
        applied to CSS styles.</li><br>
 <li>There is no difference. Just like HTML and HTML5. CSS3 is simply the newer “version” of CSS which has more 
        advanced features than earlier “releases.” Likewise, HTML5 simply is HTML and CSS3 is simply CSS. Both HTML5 and 
        CSS3 became marketing buzzwords way above and beyond the technologies that they are referring.
 </li>
 </ol>

# Question-4

### Name a few CSS style components

<b>Answer:-

> The major components of a CSS style are as follows:-

<ul>
<li> secector:   HTML element name, id name, class name.</li>
<li> Property:  It's like an attribute such as background color,font-size,position,text-align,color,border etc.</li>
<li>Values:  Which defines property or values allocate for properties.</li>
</ul>

> components of CSS:-

<ul>
<li>The components of css style are:</li>
<li>Selector:class name, id name or element name that is target.</li>
<li>Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for example border, color,background, position etc.</li>
<li> Value of Property: value that will be assigned to attribute.</li>
<ul>
<p> The CSS syntax consists of a set of rules. These rules have 3 parts: a selector, a property, and a value. You
         don't need to remember this in order to code CSS.</p>

# Question-5

### What do you understand by CSS opacity ?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li> The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind aelement is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.</li>
<li> The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element. The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent at all, 0.5 is 50%.</li>
</ol>

> Example:-

<h5> * color opacity - </h5>

- Opacity. The CSS opacity property sets the opacity for the whole element (both background color and text will be opaque/transparent). The opacity property value must be a numberbetween 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
<h5> * Image Transparency with the CSS Opacity Property -</h5>

- The opacity property takes values from 0.0 to 1.0 , with 1 being the default value for all elements. The lower the value, the more transparent. So if an element is given an opacity of 0 , it would beinvisible.

# Question-6

### How can the background color of an element be changed?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li> Approach: The background-color property of CSS is used to set the background of an element. We can set background color by selecting the element by its class name of id name and then apply the background-color property on it to set the background color.</li><br>
<li> To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.</li>
</ol>

# Question-7

### How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li>This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control therepetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image bothhorizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</li><br>
<li>To make a background image not repeat in HTML, specify no-repeat in the background-repeat property or thebackground shorthand property. The background image is set to 'no-repeat' using the 'background-repeat' property.</li><br>
<li>The background-repeat CSS property sets how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes, or not repeated at all.</li>
</ol>

# Question-8

### What is the use of the background-position property?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.</li><br>
<li>The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each background image. The position is relative to the position layer set by background-origin .</li><br>
<li>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.</li>
</ol>

# Question-9

### Which property controls the image scroll in the background?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li> The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.</li><br>
<li> The background-attachment property in CSS is used to specify the kind of attachment of the background image with respect to itscontainer. It can be set to scroll or make it remain fixed. It can be applied to all HTML elements.</li><br>
<li> Setting the value to scroll , the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically You can use the overflow property when you want to have 
         better control of the layout.</li>

# Question-10

### Why should background and color be used as separate properties?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li>There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</li><br>
<li> background is a shorthand property that allows you to set all the background properties (including the background-color ) in oneline. On the other hand, background-color property sets the color of the background of an element.</li><br>
<li> The background-color property sets the background color of an element. The background of an element is the total size of the  element, including padding and border (but not the margin). Tip: Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to read.</li><br>
<li>Color is an inherited property while the background is not.</li>
</ol>

# Question-11

### How to center block elements using CSS1?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li>To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the center tag. All the elements within the center tag will be centrally aligned.</li><br>
<li>The way to do that is to set the margins to 'auto'. This is normally used with a block of fixed width, because if the block itself is flexible, it will simply take up all the available width. Here is an example: P.blocktext { margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto; width: 8em } </li>
</ol><br>
<p>Approach: There are two steps to center a block-level element –</p>

> Step 1:

<p> Define the external width – We need to define the external width. Block-level elements have the default width of 100% of the webpage, so for centering the block element, we need space around it. So for generating the space, we are giving it a width.</p>

> Step 2:

<p> Set the left-margin and the right-margin of the element to auto – Since we produced a remaining space by providing external  width so now we need to align that space properly that’s why we should use margin property. Margin is a property that tells how to align a remaining space. So for centering the element you must set left-margin to auto and right-margin to auto.
</p>

# Question-12

### How to maintain the CSS specifications?

<b>Answer:-

<p> The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C is an international standards organization that works to develop and promote web standards. The CSS specifications are a set of standards that define how CSS should be used to style HTML documents.</p>

# Question-13

### What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?

<b>Answer:-

<i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i>

> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements

<ul>
<li>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.</li>
<li>An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
</li>
</ul>
<br>

> Internal - by using a style element in the head section

<ul>
<li>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.</li>
<li> An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.
</li>
</ul>
<br>

> External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file

<ul>
<li>An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.</li>
<li> To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:
</li>
</ul>

# Question-14

### What is embedded style sheets?

<b>Answer:-

<ol>
<li>Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the style tags containing the CSS properties in the head of yourdocument.</li><br>
<li> Embedded Style Sheets is a style sheet where designers can embed information of the style sheet in an HTML document by making use of the tags are done within head section of HTML. The syntax for embedded stylesheets has no such exception.</li>
<li> Embedded style sheets allow you to define styles for the whole HTML document in one place.</li>
<ol>

# Question-15

### What are the external style sheets?

<b>Answer:-

<p>This is considered the best way to style your HTML code. External stylesheets are totally separate from the HTML and you place them in a CSS file.</p>
<p>To use external stylesheets in your HTML, you link them within the head with the link tag.</p>

# Question-16

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?

<b>Answer:-

> External style sheets have the following advantages over internal and inline styles:

<ul>
<li> one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages.</li>
<li> you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements.</li>
<li>consistent look and feel across multiple web pages.</li>
<li>Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.</li>
<li> In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.</li>
</ul><br>

> The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:-

<ul>
<li>In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.</li>
<li>Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.</li>
<li> CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.</li>
<li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
<li> For small number of style definitions, it is not viable.</li>
</ul>

# Question-17

### What is the meaning of the CSS selector?

<b>Answer:-

<p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell thebrowser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>

> We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:-

<ol>
<li> Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
<li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
<li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
<li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
<li> Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
</ol>

# Question-18

### What are the media types allowed by CSS?

<b>Answer:-

> CSS2 Introduced Media Types:

<p>The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media  types.</p>

> Examples:

<p>You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.</p>

> CSS3 Introduced Media Queries:

Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

> Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:-

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
- resolution
<p>Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops,tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).</p>

# Question-19

### What is the rule set?

<b>Answer:-

> Introduction:

<p> A rule or "rule set" is a statement that tells browsers how to render particular elements onan HTML page. A rule set consists of a selector followed by a declaration block.</p>

> Definitions

<> A table of instructions used by a controlled interface to determine what data is allowable and how the data is handled between interconnected systems.

<p>Rule Sets are a set of Rules and Flows that are targeted to work together for complex data evaluation. Conditional Rules provide the ability to create Rule Sets within a Rule Set. A Conditional Rule Set mayevaluate conditions to determine if this Rule Set needs to be executed and may extend Rule Set input data.  </p>
